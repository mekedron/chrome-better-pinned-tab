# chrome-better-pinned-tab

This extension prevents closing pinned tabs on CTRL+W. I find it very useful for using with any browser that has vertical tabs.

## Installation

Clone this repo and [load the extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked).

Or you can install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/better-pinned-tabs/fnggnpmemlmahfgblcpmgnfopiljibnc)
